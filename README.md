# [Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section](https://testimonialgridchallenge.netlify.app/)

This is a solution to the [Testimonials grid section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7).

## Description

This challenge is a CSS Grid practice. Grid is such a powerful addition to CSS. Bootstrap 5 will be used to customize the site. Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## Installation

The project has been created using two extensions of visual studio code: [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass "Live Sass Compiler") to compile the SCSS code to CSS and [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer "Live Server") to visualize the changes made in the browser (hot reload).

To properly configure [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass "Live Sass Compiler"), I recommend you watch [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tyKkkziTc&t=10s&ab_channel=FalconMasters "this video tutorial") from the [Falcon Masters channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJl1YajcPWTeJNsQhGyMIMg "Falcon Masters channel").

In my case I have set the build directory as `dist/`. In case you configure this directory with another name, you must change it in the following line of the `index.html` file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/dist/style.css">
```

Run the command to install bootstrap with npm

```
npm i
```
